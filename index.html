    <h1>HIS ORIGIN</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Nigerian nationalist, politician, lawyer, statesman, and chancellor, Chief Jeremiah Obafemi Oyeniyi Awolowo was
      born on 6 March 1909 in the Remo town of Ikenne, in present-day Ogun State of Nigeria. He was the only son of
      David Shopolu Awolowo, a farmer and sawyer, and Mary Efunyela Awolowo. He had two sisters and one maternal
      half-sister. Awolowo's father was born to a high chief and member of the Iwarefa, the leading faction of the
      traditional Osugbo group that ruled Ikenne. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS EDUCATION</h1>
    <p>He attended various schools, including Baptist Boys' High School (BBHS), Abeokuta; and then became a teacher in
      Abeokuta, after which he qualified as a shorthand typist. Subsequently, he served as a clerk at the Wesley College
      Ibadan, as well as a correspondent for the Nigerian Times.

      Following his education at Wesley College, Ibadan, in 1927, he enrolled at the University of London as an External
      Student and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce (Hons.). He went to the UK in 1944 to study law at
      the University of London and was called to the Bar by the Honorable Society of the Inner Temple on 19 November
      1946. In 1949, Awolowo founded the Nigerian Tribune, a private Nigerian newspaper, which he used to spread
      nationalist consciousness among Nigerians.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS POLITICAL JOURNEY</h1>
    <p>In 1945, he attended the fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester as a representative of the Nigerian Youth
      Movement along with H. O. Davies. Amongst an illustrious list of attendees included Kwame Nkrumah, Hastings Banda,
      Jomo Kenyatta and Jaja Wachuku to name a few. Awolowo was Nigeria's foremost federalist. In his Path to Nigerian
      Freedom (1947) – the first systematic federalist manifesto by a Nigerian politician – he advocated federalism as
      the only basis for equitable national integration and, as head of the Action Group, he led demands for a federal
      constitution, which was introduced in the 1954 Lyttleton Constitution, following primarily the model proposed by
      the Western Region delegation led by him.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="section4" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE</h1>
    <p>From the eve of independence, he led the Action Group as the Leader of the Opposition in the federal parliament,
      leaving Samuel Ladoke Akintola as the Western Region Premier. Disagreements between Awolowo and Akintola on how to
      run the Western region led the latter to an alliance with the Tafawa Balewa-led NPC federal government. A
      constitutional crisis led to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Western Region, eventually resulting
      in a widespread breakdown of law and order.

      Excluded from national government, Awolowo and his party faced an increasingly precarious position.[citation
      needed] Akintola's followers, angered at their exclusion from power, formed the Nigerian National Democratic Party
      (NNDP) under Akintola's leadership. Having previously suspended the elected Western Regional Assembly, the federal
      government then reconstituted the body after manoeuvres that brought Akintola's NNDP into power without an
      election. Shortly afterwards Awolowo and several disciples were arrested, charged, convicted (of treason), and
      jailed under Balewa for conspiring with the Ghanaian authorities to overthrow the federal government. In 1979 and
      1983, he contested under the Unity Party's platform as a presidential candidate, but lost to the northern-based
      National Party of Shehu Shagari.</p>

  <div id="section5" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS HONOURS</h1>
    <p>He is featured in the 100 Naira banknote since 1999.

      In addition to a variety of other chieftaincy titles, Chief Awolowo held the title of the Odole Oodua of Ile-Ife.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="section6" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS LEGACY</h1>
    <p>n 1992, the Obafemi Awolowo Foundation was founded as an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organisation
      committed to furthering the symbiotic interaction of public policy and relevant scholarship with a view to
      promoting the overall development of the Nigerian nation. The Foundation was launched by the President of Nigeria
      at that time, General Ibrahim Babangida, at the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan. However, his most important bequests
      (styled Awoism) are his exemplary integrity, his welfarism, his contributions to hastening the process of
      decolonisation and his consistent and reasoned advocacy of federalism-based on ethno-linguistic self-determination
      and uniting politically strong states-as the best basis for Nigerian unity. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="section7" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>HIS DEATH</h1>
    <p> Awolowo died peacefully at his Ikenne home, the Efunyela Hall (so named after his mother), on 9 May 1987, at the
      age of 78 and was laid to rest in Ikenne, amid tributes across political and ethno-religious divides.</p>
